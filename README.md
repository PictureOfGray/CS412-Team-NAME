# CS412-Team-NAME
For JMU's CS412
Objectives:
-implement a brute-force approach to solve Traveling Salesman Problem and analyze its runtime complexity
-present/discuss an NP-completeness proof to a group of colleagues and justify that an approximation method is appropriate
-create an approximation method for a known NP-complete problem and present its strengths and weaknesses.
-implement a reduction to another NP complete problem and compare the performance
-improve presentation skills (both speaking and slide creation) by giving and receiving peer feedback
